Real Time Stock Ticker
Project Description:

The Real-Time Stock Ticker project is a web-based dashboard that continuously displays live stock market prices for selected companies. It fetches real-time data using a stock market API (like Twelve Data, Alpha Vantage, or Yahoo Finance) and dynamically updates stock values, charts, and performance trends without page reloads.

The main goal is to provide instant and interactive visualization of stock price fluctuations, helping users (investors, traders, and analysts) monitor the market efficiently.

The application is built using HTML, CSS, JavaScript (with Chart.js) for the front end and can be integrated with Node.js or Python (Flask/Streamlit) for backend API calls.

Uniqueness of the Project:

Real-time updates: Automatically fetches new stock prices at short intervals (every few seconds).

Live charts: Visual representation of stock trends over time using dynamic line charts.

User-customizable stocks: Users can select which companies to monitor.

Data caching: Optimized to store and update only the latest few data points to improve performance.

API-driven: Uses live market APIs to ensure accuracy and real-world relevance.

Interactive dashboard: Aesthetic UI with ticker animation and color-coded price indicators (green for gain, red for loss).

Key Features:

Live Stock Updates – Continuously fetches and displays real-time stock data.

Dynamic Charts – Shows the last few prices in a line chart for each stock.

Color Indicators – Highlights price rise (green) or fall (red).

Search/Add Stock Option – Allows users to add new stock symbols dynamically.

Automatic Refresh – Updates every few seconds without manual reload.

API Integration – Fetches live data using Twelve Data API (or similar).

Responsive Dashboard – Works on desktop and mobile screens.

Error Handling – Displays fallback messages for invalid or unavailable stocks.

Technical Stack:

Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Chart.js

Backend (Optional): Node.js / Flask

API: Twelve Data / Alpha Vantage API

Hosting: GitHub Pages / Replit / Render

Outcome:

By the end of the project, you’ll have a fully functional, visually interactive dashboard that streams live stock prices in real time, helping users analyze and track market trends efficiently.
